# Gas Field Multi-period Optimization Under Harmonic Decline

## Abstract
In operating a gas field, petroleum firms would like to maximize the condensate production. This process is usually done with a single-period linear optimization. However, some production constraints, especially the Harmonic decline pattern of the wells, are nonlinear and nonconvex. Moreover, the solution to a single-period optimization problem can be drastically different from the multi-period one as the former ignores the time domain completely. 

In this project, we formulate a multi-period production optimization problem with Harmonic decline as a nonlinear optimization problem. We then solve it with the augmented Lagrangian technique and use the gradient projection method with trust-region to solve the subproblem. We show that the technique works perfectly under different scenarios by reporting the corresponding production schemes and explaining their semantics.
